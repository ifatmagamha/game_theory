# 🎮 Game Theory – Strategic Thinking and AI Applications

Welcome to the **Game Theory** repository! This project showcases a structured and visual overview of core game theory concepts, alongside their modern applications in artificial intelligence.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This presentation provides a theoretical and visual guide to understanding game theory, covering:

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- Players, strategies, payoffs, rationality, and information sets
- Game representations: **Normal form** vs **Extensive form**
- Perfect and imperfect information

### 🔹 Typology of Games
- **Static** vs **Dynamic**
- **Cooperative** vs **Non-Cooperative**
- **Zero-Sum** vs **Non-Zero-Sum**

### 🔹 Strategy & Equilibrium
- Pure and mixed strategies
- **Nash Equilibrium**
- Dominant strategies and best responses
- Backward induction and subgame perfection

### 🔹 Real-World Applications
- Public goods, subsidies, and competitive markets
- Classic problems like the **Prisoner’s Dilemma**, **Battle of the Sexes**, and **Rock-Paper-Scissors**

### 🔹 Game Theory Meets AI
- Introduction to strategic interactions between intelligent agents
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** modeled as zero-sum games
- How game theory improves AI learning dynamics and decision-making

## 🧪 Upcoming: Agent-Based Game Simulation

An interactive simulation will soon be available to explore:
- Multi-agent decision-making
- Dynamic equilibrium finding
- AI behaviors in competitive settings


> “Game theory turns complex decision-making into structured reasoning. With AI, it’s no longer theoretical — it’s how machines learn to play smart.”
